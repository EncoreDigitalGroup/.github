# Contribution Guidelines

In addition to
the [Encore Digital Group Contribution Terms](https://github.com/EncoreDigitalGroup/.github/blob/main/CODE-CONTRIBUTION-TERMS.md),
the following procedures are in place for contributing to this repository.

## Preparing your pull request branch

Once you have completed your feature or failing test, it's time to submit your Pull Request (PR) to the repository.
First, ensure that you commit your changes to a separate branch (avoid using main). To create a new branch,
you can use the git command:

```bash
git checkout -b my-feature
```

You can name your branch anything you want, but for future reference, it's helpful to use a descriptive name that
reflects your feature or failing test.

Next, commit your changes to your branch. You can use `git add .` to stage all changes and then
`git commit -m "Add my feature"` to commit all changes with a descriptive commit message.

However, your branch is currently only available on your local machine. To create a Pull Request, you need to push your
branch to your forked repository using `git push`.

```bash
git push origin my-feature
```

## Submitting your pull request

We're almost there! Open your web browser and navigate to your forked repository (https://github.com/<
your-username>/<repository-name>). In the center of your screen, you will see a new notification: "my-feature had
recent pushes 1 minute ago" along with a button that says "Compare & pull request." Click the button to open the pull
request form.

In the form, provide a title that describes your pull request and then proceed to the description section. The text area
already contains a predefined template. Try to answer every question:
