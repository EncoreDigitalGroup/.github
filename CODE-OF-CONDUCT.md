# Contributor Code of Conduct

Our [company values](https://auth0.com/careers/culture) guide us in our day-to-day interactions and decision-making. Our
open source projects are no exception. Trust, respect, collaboration and transparency are core values we believe should
live and breathe within our projects. Our community welcomes participants from around the world with different
experiences, unique perspectives, and great ideas to share.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an productive environment, we as contributors and maintainers will engage with each other
in a genuine and professional manner. Blatant disrespect will not be tolerated. While you do not need to agree with
opposing viewpoints, you are expected to be respectful of the person behind the viewpoint. Failure to do so may result
in your inability to contribute to this project or other projects within the organization.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Attempting collaboration before conflict
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- Violence, threats of violence, or inciting others to commit self-harm
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Intentionally sharing unconfirmed information as fact. If information is unconfirmed, you may share it in an effort to
  confirm or deny its validity, but you must make it clear that the information is unconfirmed.
- Public or private harassment
- Abuse of the reporting process
- Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take
appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits,
issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any
contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the
project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline
event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to project maintainers directly.
All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate
to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an
incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent
repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership.

If you are unsure whether an incident is a violation, or whether the space where the incident took place is covered by
our Code of Conduct, **we encourage you to still report it**. We would prefer to have a few extra reports where we
decide to take no action, than to leave an incident go unnoticed and unresolved that may result in an individual or
group to feel like they can no longer participate in the community. Reports deemed as not a violation will also allow us
to improve our Code of Conduct and processes surrounding it. If you witness a dangerous situation or someone in
distress, we encourage you to report even if you are only an observer.
